# Hi there!

I'm Ammar Jahin. I like studying how things work, and exploring interesting ideas. 
This curiosity has led me to a PhD in theoretical physics, which I obtained from the University of Florida working under the supervision of Yuxuan Wang. 
After my PhD I did a postdoc at Los Alamos National Lab. 
One lesson I keep learning over and over is that any subject can be interested when viewed with the right lens. 
With this view, I have developed interests in many topics, ranging from quantum materials, quantum information/computations, theory of computations, and machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
In this blog, I write on topics and ideas that I find interesting, but maybe not necessarily have the time to study deep enough to contribute something new to the human knowledge.
